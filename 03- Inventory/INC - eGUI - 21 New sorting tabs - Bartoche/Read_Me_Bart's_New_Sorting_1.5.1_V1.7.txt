Hi Stalkers,

I'm working actually on my mods to update them for Anomaly 1.5.1. So i hope i can upload them nearly.

This mod is a new work, i decided to do that because the default sorting is for me a little bit short.

Adds 2 news sorting tabs, one dedicated for "Medicine" and another one dedicated for "Upgrades".

My addon changes too the sorting, for example, all explosives are in the weapons tab, attachements are with armors tab...

We'll see and naturally, i hope you like it and i 'll appreciate your feedback and comments.


THIS ADDON WORKS ONLY IN 1.5.1

Enjoy !

Setup advices : (i advice to use a mod manager)

Without mod manager, simply copy "gamedata" folder in your game's directory.



If you have some problems to use this addon, you can let me know a comment and i'd be delighted to respond.


Enjoy !
