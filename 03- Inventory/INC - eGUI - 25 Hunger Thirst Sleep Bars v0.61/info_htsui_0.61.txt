		module 25 added "hts_inventory_bars.script" from  "Hunger Thirst Sleep UI by xcvb" to prevent broken bars.
		
		
		
		
		resc info
			htsui version "actor_status_sleep.script" is moved to resc, this addon now now using script from immersive sleep addon.
	
		
		
		this patch doesn't require main addon and based on htsui 0.61 but improved.
		
		these files are borrowed from "htsui 0.61" 
		NOTE: following files are needs compability problems with "Immersive sleep" and various balancing mods.
		"actor_status_thirst.script", "actor_status_sleep.script" scripts.
		

		works with better stats bars, and doesn't require "xcvb" versions.
		
		

		ATTENTION : "htsui 0.61" addon is required for this patch to work properly. somehow game doesn't seems to crash without the main addon.
		"htsui 0.61" mod works with or without "better stats bar update 7"
		
		BIG NOTE: bars are longer than usual even they was were fixed, because better stats bar was active and its controlling it somehow.. changing sizes doesn't effect in vanilla code. Enabling "htsui 0.71 xcvb" and it's patch. fixes the issue.
		
		NOTE: If you use xcvb's version "hunger thirst ui 0.71" thirst and sleep bars will not work.
		
		
		"hunger_sensor" code in "ui_inventory.xml" cannot be disabled because required for "htsui 0.61". 
		also we moved the code because game already have sensor in original. so without the main addon "htsui 0.61" hunger sensor will work. but not thirst and sleep.
