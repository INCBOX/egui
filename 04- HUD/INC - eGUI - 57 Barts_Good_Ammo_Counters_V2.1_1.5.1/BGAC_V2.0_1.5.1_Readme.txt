Hi Stalkers !

Here it is an addon to add counters for good ammo for 1.5.1 only
Total compatibility with weapons addon.


Setup instructions:

With a mod manager or simply paste the gamedata folder in your games directory.


What does this addon exactly ?

IMPORTANT TO KNOW, THIS ADDON IS COMPATIBLE WITH ALL WEAPONS ADDONS, no patches, nothing to do.

* Shows the total amount of ammo you have for each 3 types available in the inventory. (Traffic Signals Colors : Green --> Good Ammo -- Orange --> Bad Ammo -- Red --> Very Bad Ammo)
* If you want, you can display too bad/verybad ammos counters. (verybad ammos are not availables in 1.5.1, but the addon can manage it anyway, if the option is activated, a red zero is displayed when you are out of ammos.)

Some options are availables in MCM menu or in Video/Options UI/HUD if you are not using MCM.
For example, you can change the color display for ammo counters.

COMPATIBILITY :
You can use actually, SidHUD,Vodis and GBHSR (Grok's Body Health System) with B.G.A.C. We can find in the folder "Compatibility patches", "_ CP_BGAC_SIDHUD ", "_ CP_BGAC_VODIS" and _ CP_BGAC_GBHSR.

Of course it will be possible next updates to improve this addon, depending on your feedback...

Thanks to Ravenascendant for his help, his script and sure the awesome MCM.https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/anomaly-mod-configuration-menu
