I've decided to work on that addon because i miss Call Of Tchernobyl's radar stealth bar and detection bar.

Stealth bar and detection bar are back for Anomaly 1.5.1 !









Setup instructions : (i advice to use a mod manager)

Without mod manager, simply paste "gamedata" folder in your game's directory.

See Changelog.txt

You can find some Compatibility patches, _ CP_Bart's_Radars_Bars_With_VANILLA_MINIMAP_OUT and _ CP_Bart's_Radars_Bars_With_BART'S_MINIMAP.

If you have some problems to use this addon, you can let me know a comment and i'd be delighted to respond.


Enjoy !
